# ðŸš€ Astruno

**Astruno** is a free and open-source template to make your website using **[Astro 2.0](https://astro.build/blog/astro-2/) + [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/)**. Ready to start a new project and designed taking into account web best practices. This project is inspired by **[AstroWind](https://github.com/onwidget/astrowind)**, but with **[UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/)**
